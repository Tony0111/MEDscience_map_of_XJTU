# .gitignore for a Python Data Analysis Research Project
# ===================================================================

# --- User-Specific Exclusions ---
# Per your request, ignore the data directory and Obsidian configuration.

# 1. Ignore all contents of the /data/ directory.
# This prevents large data files (nbib, csv, etc.) from being uploaded.
# The leading slash ensures it only matches the 'data' folder in the root directory.
# /data/

# 2. Ignore the Obsidian vault configuration folder.
# This is CRITICAL to prevent leaking API keys or other secrets.
.obsidian/


# --- Sensitive Information & Credentials (Best Practice) ---
# It's a great habit to explicitly ignore common secret file names.
# This prevents you from accidentally committing API keys in other formats.
